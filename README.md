# StarfleetMineClearing

What the project does?

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Starfleet Mine Clearing Exercise. The description of this exercise is included in the Starfleet Mine Clearing Exercise.pdf.

How users can get started with the project?

This project has been compiled using Clang++ in a Mac system, so to get started you need to set up a Mac system with Clang++ installed in it.

Once you have your Mac setup and Clang++ installed, just proceed to run 'make' in the root directory of your repository. Running make creates an executable StarfleetMineClearing.out. This executable needs a script and a field file to run the simulation.

There are several examples provided in the fields and scripts directories which can be used as shown below:
./StarfleetMineClearing.out ./scripts/Exercise1.script ./fields/Exercise1.fields

Can users help with your project?

If you are interested in helping improve this C++ implementation, please check the TODO.txt file. This file contains several improvements that can be done to the source code.
