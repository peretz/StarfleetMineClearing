This file lists several tasks that are still pending.

-> Add error handling to the program: The program uses files, arithmetic and objects that are not exception free. There is error handling still needed.
-> In several places, object are returned as a copy. This is time consuming so we could leverage move semantics.
-> The only tests executed in the program are functional tests. We can reorganize the classes so that we do dependency injection and mock/unit test classes.
-> Consider separting the Simulation class into two classes.
-> Clean up @TODOs in the code.
-> Document interfaces
-> Fix flipped Y axis. The y axis substracts when going north, this is counterintuitive and an implementation detail from the Field class.
-> Improve command line options and error handling.
-> Consider moving the printView() method, which is currently a friend method, as a public method for the Field class.
